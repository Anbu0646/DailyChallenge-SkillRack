'''

The program must accept N integers as the input. If N is even, the program must print the sum of middle four integers among N integers as the output. Else the program must print the sum of middle three integers among N integers as the output. 

Boundary Condition(s): 5 <= N <= 100 1 <= Each Integer Value <= 9999 

Input Format:  The first line contains the integer N. 
               The second line contains N integers separated by space(s). 
               
Output Format: The first line contains either the sum of middle four integers or the sum of middle three integers among N integers. 

Example Input/Output 1: 

Input:  5 
        2 3 5 7 6 
Output: 15 

Explanation: Here N = 5 which is odd. 
             So the middle 3 integers are 3, 5 and 7. 
             The sum of the middle three integers is 15 (3 + 5 + 7). 
             Hence the output is 15. 
             
Example Input/Output 2: 

Input:  6 
        23 47 63 52 77 56 
Output: 239
